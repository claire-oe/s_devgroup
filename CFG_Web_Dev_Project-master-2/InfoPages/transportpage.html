                                          sustainable development, and is used to describe modes of transport, and

                                          The role of transport in sustainable development was first recognized at the 1992 United 
                                          Nation's Earth Summit and reinforced in its outcome document- Agenda 21.

                                          Travelling to and from our meeting destination creates a lot of CO2 emission and it is important 
                                          to make an effort to reduce the footprint as much as possible.
                                          
                                          
                                          The field of green transportation has expanded a lot in the past few years, owing to the rising 
                                          petrol and gas prices across the world.  Green transportation is not just important for the current 
                                          time but also for the future and needs to be developed even further.

                                                            and electric cars, which operate by a set of batteries and electric motor. They are also designed 
                                                            to optimize their gas mileage. A vast majority of hybrid cars are designed to automatically recharge
                                                            their batteries by converting energy in the course of braking. Greenhouse emissions in hybrid cars 
                                                            are extremely low; emissions can range from 26% - 90% lower compared to standard cars. 
                                                            According to experts, hybrid cars cut down health-threatening emissions by over 90%. While hybrid

                                                            Trains are getting increasingly greener with hybrid locomotives and other innovative green technologies. 
                                                            The innovative hybrid locomotives utilize similar technologies applied in hybrid cars.
                                                            The advantage of these electric trains is that they travel at tops speeds of more than 200 mph, 
                                                            yet maintaining high levels of safety.
                                                            This saves a lot of time and gives more efficiency in connecting destinations with each other.
